## Background Info

I am buiding a program in ~~C++~~ that gives the user an option to either **signup** or **login**.
If the user chooses to signup, the system saves his/her details in a file that will  
be accessed when the user is logging in.

------
After the user has logged in, the system is going to allow the user to covert his/her chosen currency to a US dollar value
* Have you username  
* Have your Password  
* Click Login  
> This is one line of text  
> This is another line of text

We will then test this out on a new server inside github to see if it will display

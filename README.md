# LoginSystem
## Background Info

I am buiding a program in **C++** that gives the user an option to login using their credentials.  The system would then compare those input credentials against existing credentials in a text file. If there is a match, the system will tell the user that he/she is logged  in successful otherwise it will tell him/her that loggin failed.

------
After logging in, the system is going to show the user my pdf resume
* Have you username  
* Have your Password  
* Click Enter 
> This is one line of text  
> This is another line of text

We will then test this out on a new server inside github to see if it will display
